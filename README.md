# Example Hub

Example Hub is a website that serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions about Math and Science. Similarly to high profile websites like Stackoverflow and Reddit, these Answers and Questions can be voted on to better represent what the questions are or the best answers to those questions. The thing that sets Example Hub apart is that direct answers to questions are discouraged instead requesting answers in a roundabout way that question askers can learn from. Example Hub will be useful for students seeking to learn the material and not just get an answer to a homework question.
